# Skill data descriptions
This is UmaTL's repository providing skill descriptions based on raw data extracted from the game.  
It is made for Hachimi.

# Install / Use
Follow the instructions at [UmaTL's main translation repository](https://github.com/UmaTL/hachimi-tl-en?tab=readme-ov-file#umamusume-english-translations) (follow the manual change method for the config).  
Hachimi's first-time setup will then allow you to select any of UmaTL's sources for modifying game text.  
Select either Skill Data option depending on if you would like to have translations as well.

> [!CAUTION] 
> Do **NOT** select translation repos if you play the global version.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> The skill data is based on the Japanese version. Some skills will differ if using on global due to updates.
> I will consider a global-specific version if there is enough interest and support.
